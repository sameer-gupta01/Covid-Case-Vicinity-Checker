# Covid-Case-Vicinity-Checker
Given a suburb, radius and timeframe it checks your vicinity to recent covid cases.

It scrapes the NSW Government Covid data to obtain the case dates and suburbs. I then use an open source map web api to obtain the longitude and latitude of each suburb with a 
case. I then use these values to calculate the distance and filter which returns the suburbs within the given radius. The result is then visualised using an interactive heat map.
